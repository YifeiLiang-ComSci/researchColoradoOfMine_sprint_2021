An important characteristic of the present study was the use of a semi-supervised classification method for the AD conversion prediction in MCI subjects. The semi-supervised method (LDS) was shown to outperform its counterpart supervised method (SVM) in the design of MRI biomarker.

\section{Conclusion}
% In this work we aim to detect the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progress in its early stage from the longitudinal multi-modal healthcare dataset, 
We present the semi-supervised enrichment learning method to integrate the longitudinal multi-modal dataset, which fits to the clinical applicability and can be used in a real-time automatic AD diagnosis. The novel LSTM autoencoder is introduced to compress longitudinal records with missing data into a fixed-length vectorial representation. Armed with the enriched representation, we can fully utilize the genotypic and phenotypic data. Our experiments show that our model beats the performance of the competing predictive models in AD prediction. In addition, combined with the perturbation based feature identification method, our model discovers the neuroimaging and genetic biomarkers associated with AD, further adding value to our approach.

% We have conducted extensive experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset~\cite{risacher2010longitudinal} and 
% achieved promising performance on multiclass AD progression prediction task with the various number of labeled samples. In our experiments with the proposed model, we identify the disease-relevant biomarkers through the perturbation based feature identification method.

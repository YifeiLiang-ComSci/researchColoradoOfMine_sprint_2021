    Learning compressed representations of multivariate time series (MTS) facilitates data analysis in the presence of noise and redundant information, and for a large number of variates and time steps. However, classical dimensionality reduction approaches are designed for vectorial data and cannot deal explicitly with missing values. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder architecture based on recurrent neural networks to generate compressed representations of MTS.
    
    Although semi-supervised variational autoencoder (SemiVAE) works in image classiﬁcation task, it fails in text classiﬁcation task if using vanilla LSTM as its decoder. From a perspective of reinforcement learning, it is veriﬁed that the decoder’s capability to distinguish between different categorical labels is essential. Therefore, Semi-supervised Sequential Variational Autoencoder (SSVAE) is proposed, which increases the capability by feeding label into its decoder RNN at each time-step. Two speciﬁc decoder structures are investigated and both of them are veriﬁed to be effective.

  An influx of COVID-19 infections puts extreme pressure on healthcare systems and the efficient allocation of finite resources becomes a crucial problem. Because clinical measurements of COVID-19 patients can be collected over time, many longitudinal learning models have been presented to predict the clinical outcomes from the multivariate time series (MTS) and thus aid in logistical decision making. However, they often fail to integrate static data with the MTS or utilize the available labels of samples. We propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework that leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder to learn the vectorial representation of MTS which can be easily integrated with the static data. Armed with vectorial representation summarizing the MTS and static data, conventional machine learning models can be used to predict clinical outcomes. In our experiments of two case studies, the proposed model shows promising prediction performance on mortality rates of 358 COVID-19 patients and 3997 ICU patients with their temporal records collected from blood tests. In addition, the proposed model identifies the risk factors of mortality.

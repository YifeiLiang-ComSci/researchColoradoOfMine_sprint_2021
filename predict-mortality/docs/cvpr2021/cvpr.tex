%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that severely causes problems on patient's thinking, memory, and behavior. As early diagnosis is important to prevent AD progression, many biomarker analysis models have been presented to predict clinical outcomes. However, these models often fail to integrate heterogeneous genotypic and phenotype biomarkers to improve diagnosis prediction and/or are not able to deal with the incomplete longitudinal biomarkers with missing entries/records. Thus we propose the semi-supervised augmentation learning method to learn a abstract vectorial representation of multimodal longitudinal biomarkers. We use a composite model of  autoencoders based on Recurrent Neural Network. Our experiments show that our augmentation model improves the prediction performance on AD progression.

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
%% --- Useful instructions from template:
% Papers, excluding the references section,
% must be no longer than eight pages in length. The references section
% will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the
% length of the references section. For example, a paper of eight pages
% with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.

% Please number all of your sections and displayed equations.~\cite{Authors14}
